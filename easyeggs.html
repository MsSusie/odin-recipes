        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>(Serves 1 person)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2-3 eggs beaten</li>
                    <li>2-3 tbsp creme fraiche or can use ricotta cheese</li>
                    <li>herbs
                        <ul>
                            <li>1/4 tbsp thyme</li>
                            <li>1/4 tbsp oregano</li>
                            <li>1/4 tbsp basil</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>olive oil</li>
                    <li>unsalted butter - 1 tbsp</li>
                    <li>chives (optional)</li>
                    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a pan that is nonstick and has a tall side. You need this so that when stirring the eggs, they don't spill over on the side. Put a tbsp of butter and a tbsp of olive oil in the pan. Heat up well and melt over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Pour the beaten eggs into the heated pan. Let sit for about 30 seconds so that they set a little bit. Then using a silicone spatula, start mixing the egg. Take off heat and keep mixing.</li>
                    <li>Alternate between putting the pan on the heat and taking off the heat while stirring. You want the egg to cook but not be too firm or rubbery.</li>
                    <li>Start seasoning the egg mixture once the eggs are getting a little firm. Add the thyme, oregano, and basil. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>Turn off the stove and take the pan off heat. Add the creme fraiche to the egg mixture and mix well. The eggs should look a little loose, a little bit like porridge, but shouldn't be raw. If you don't like your eggs that loose, you can cook a little further before adding the creme fraiche.</li>
                    <li>Plate the egg mixture and add some of the chopped chives. Enjoy!</li>
