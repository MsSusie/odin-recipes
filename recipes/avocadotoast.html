        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe's main ingredient is surprise, avocado! You will need to make sure that the avocado you use is ripe. You can tell the ripeness of your avocado by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the body of the avocado feel really firm? If so, it's not ripe. It should feel like it is soft but not too soft (else that avocado is too far gone).</li>
                    <li>See where the end has a stem? If it feels soft there and the stem falls off easily, it is probably ripe.</li>
                    <li>If your avocado is not yet ripe, place it in a paper bag with an apple for a day or 2. The ethylene gas will help speed up the process.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
                       
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <p>(Serves 1 person)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 ripe avocado</li>
                    <li>2 pieces of toast, I prefer using sourdough bread</li>
                    <li>lime juice (about 1/4 to 1/2 of a lime which is about 1-2 tbsp, depends on how big your avocado is)</li>
                    <li>garlic powder</li>
                    <li>red chili flakes (optional)</li>
                    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut open the avocado by carefully slicing lengthwise along the side of the avocado until you make a full pass. Twist open the avocado and remove the seed. Slice the avocado into chunks and put into a mixing bowl. Don't make the chunks too small, when they are mixed, they will end up smashed anyways.</li>
                    <li>Add to the avocado chunks: lime juice, 2 small shakes of garlic powder (about 1/4 tsp), salt and pepper to taste. Mix carefully and fully. You can choose to mix it so that it becomes a consistency like guacamole but I like my avocado to have some smoothness with small chunks still.</li> 
                    <li>Once you have seasoned the avocado mixture to your liking, spread over 2 toasted pieces of bread. Add some red chili flakes to top each if you like and enjoy.</li>
                </ol>
